# Northcoders News

## The Project
Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website.

Northcoders News has articles which are divided into three topics: football, cooking and coding. Articles can be sorted by date, votes and comments. Users can rate articles by up or down voting them. Users can also add comments about an article and can sort the comments by date or votes.

Northcoders News is a React application, it was built with JavaScript. I used Axios to make API calls to my Northcoders News API and Reach Router to render the app's different components.
