# Northcoders News

## The Project
Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website.

Northcoders News has articles which are divided into three topics: football, cooking and coding. Users can either view a list of all articles on the home page or view a page for each topic with a list of related articles. Articles can be sorted by date, votes and comments. Users can view individual articles and can rate them by up or down voting. Users can also view the comments belonging to an article and can sort the comments by date or votes. Users can rate comments, add comments about an article and can delete their own comments.

Northcoders News is a React application, it was built with JavaScript. I used Axios to make API calls to my Northcoders News API and Reach Router to render the app's different components. The app was styled with CSS.
